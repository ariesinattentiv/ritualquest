Demons

Demons aren’t picky, all they want to do is get into our world so they can wreak whatever prophetic havoc they’ve been assigned so the material isn’t important. It just needs to be something that can burn so it can be set aflame, which, if your circle is crafted correctly, will initiate the summon! Unfortunately, this means they can’t be reused, but most people aren’t summoning demons on the regular anyways.
As for shape, all demon summoning circles are made up of two parts: the outer shape, which is the same for every demon, and the inner sigil that corresponds to the particular demon. More powerful named demons will have their own unique sigil, but common demons like elemental demons, succubi, and djinn all share a common sigil.
