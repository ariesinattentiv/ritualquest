# Game Design Document (GDD) Team Project Template (Sophie, Zarifa, Eve)

## 1. Game Concept
Working Title: Ritual Quest

Genre: Puzzle / Mystery Exploration 

Platform(s): PC

Elevator Pitch (1–2 sentences):
In an abandoned research institute, the player must uncover how to complete the ritual. By decoding the researchers’ unfinished work, they learn the secrets behind the summoning circle, candles, and incantation- and must decide if ritual should ever be finished. 

Target Audience:  Players who enjoy story-driven environmental puzzle games. 

## 2. Core Loop
Describe the main repeating cycle of your game (what the player does over and over):
The player explores different departments of the abandoned research institute. 
Each room hides clues, research notes, or diagrams. 
Solving puzzles reveals more of the ritual’s design. 
The cycle repeats with increasing complexity as players piece together the final rituals. 

## 3. Game Mechanics
Player Actions (What can the player do?):
Walk/Explore Rooms.
Interact with notes, books, diagrams, tools. 
Rotate or move objects – candles, symbols.  

Interactions (How do players interact with the game world or characters?):
Clues are hidden in murals, research journals, 
Books and notes contain diagrams that players must interpret. 
Sound serves as feedback when progress is made. 

Rules (What constraints or systems define the gameplay?):
Each puzzle follows internal logic. 
Incorrect actions give hints. 

Progression (How does the game increase in difficulty or complexity?):
Each puzzle is guided by clear research notes. 
As the player advances notes become vague, forcing them to apply what they have learned from previous clues notes. 
Final puzzles require combining multiple sources.
Difficulty grows as the player “progresses” with the research and has fewer notes to guide them. 

## 4. Story & Narrative (if applicable) 
Premise (What is the story/world about?):
There isn’t much of a world - the game takes place inside a research facility, so the player’s world is completely focused on anthropological research. The story is about playing as a researcher who chooses whether to use their discoveries for knowledge or chaos.

Main Characters:
Player character - a researcher in possession of the unfinished work of a previous researcher

Conflict/Goal (What drives the player?):
The player character wants to uncover the secrets of a demon lost to time, and as they play they can choose whether to summon this demon in the pursuit of knowledge, or to set it loose to wreak havoc.

Story Delivery (Cutscenes, dialogue, environmental storytelling, etc.):
Short pop-up blurb at the beginning of the game to set the scene, environmental storytelling as they explore the institute

## 5. Level & World Design
Setting/Theme:
Our game is set in a research outpost attempting to decode messages left by an ancient civilization - the exact nature of the research is left up to interpretation, but there are religious, spiritual, and botanical themes scattered throughout.

Level Structure (linear, open world, hub-based?):
Hub-based - the entire game takes place inside the research outpost, revolving around a central ritual chamber.

Tutorial/Onboarding (How will players learn mechanics?):
There aren’t really any mechanics to learn other than movement, which is set to be as intuitive as possible. It's a typical point and click game, which is fairly simple to figure out without any sort of guide. This also helps with immersion.
Small pop up at the beginning of the game showing buttons for movement and interaction

Exploration/Challenges:
The puzzles set up throughout the building comprise all of the game’s difficulty. The singular goal of figuring out how to complete a ritual has different pieces that the player themselves must uncover in order to progress and eventually end the game.

## 6. Visual & Audio Style
Art Style Reference (pixel art, 3D, realistic, low poly, etc.):
I’m actually super happy with what we’ve settled on for an art style - physical media, such as drawings, cutouts, and origami, put through similar post-processing software to create cohesion. I think it’s going to look incredible and really get the themes of the game across.

Sound Design (music, sound effects, voice acting):
I don’t think we’ll need any voice acting, but the background music will aim to be as unobtrusive as possible - something contemplative without being too mysterious. Forgettable but not boring.

## 7. User Interface (UI/UX)
HUD (Heads-Up Display) Elements (health, score, minimap, etc.):
The facility is small enough that there is currently no minimap planned. The player also cannot die or gain score, so neither of those need to be included either. Our plan is for the screen to be split into an overworld section and an item section, both of which the player can interact with at any time.

Menus (main, pause, inventory, etc.):
The menus will share the same stylings as the rest of the game’s visuals - post-processed physical media. I have specific ideas for how these will appear.

Accessibility Features (if any):
I don’t think any are required for this specific kind of game - the only barrier is your own puzzle solving ability. We may have hints scattered around, but I’m not sure if that quite counts.

## 8. Technical Requirements
Game Engine:
Godot 4.5.

Programming Language(s):
GDScript.

Tools for Assets (art, sound, etc.):
Cardboard, construction paper, Dither Boy, BFXR, and any royalty free music site we end up deciding on.

Deployment Platform (PC build, web, mobile, etc.):
PC. I don’t think we’re planning on porting it anywhere else, though it’s a possibility.
